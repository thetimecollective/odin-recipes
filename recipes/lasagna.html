<p>Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the wait. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>3/4 lb.</strong> lasagna noodles</li>
    <li><strong>1 tsp.</strong> extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
    <li><strong>2 lb.</strong> ground beef</li>
    <li><strong>4</strong> cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li><strong>2 tsp.</strong> dried oregano</li>
    <li>Kosher salt</li>
    <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li><strong>2</strong>(32-oz.) jars marinara</li>
    <li><strong>16 oz.</strong> whole milk ricotta</li>
    <li><strong>1/2 c.</strong> freshly grated Parmesan, divided</li>
    <li><strong>1/4 c.</strong>chopped parsley, plus more for garnish</li>
    <li><strong>1</strong>large egg</li>
    <li><strong>2 lb.</strong> mozzarella</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375ยบ. In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta according to package directions until al dente, less 2 minutes. Drain and drizzle a bit of olive oil to prevent noodles from sticking together.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, in a large pot over medium-high heat, heat oil. Cook ground beef until no longer pink, breaking up with a wooden spoon. Remove from heat and drain fat. Return beef to skillet and add garlic and oregano and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper, then add marinara and stir until warmed through.</li>
    <li>Combine ricotta, 1/4 cup Parmesan, parsley, and egg in a large mixing bowl and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.</li>
    <li>In a large casserole dish, evenly spread a quarter of the meat sauce across the bottom of the dish, then top with a single layer of lasagna noodles, a layer of ricotta mixture, a single layer of mozzarella, and a layer of meat sauce. Repeat layers, topping the last layer of noodles with meat sauce, Parmesan, and mozzarella.</li>
    <li>Cover with foil and bake for 15 minutes, then increase temperature to 400ยบ and bake uncovered for 18 to 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Garnish with parsley before serving.</li>
