<p>Chicken Marsala is the American version of a classic Italian Scaloppine. It's a popular chicken dish that is tossed in a delicious and creamy sauce made with marsala wine and packed with mushrooms. The best part? You can make this restaurant dish at home in just 30 minutes.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>chicken breasts</strong> - boneless and skinless chicken breasts seasoned with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li><strong>all-purpose flour</strong> - for dredging (coating) the chicken with to give it an extra crispy golden crust.</li>
    <li><strong>olive oil</strong> - for searing the chicken.</li>
    <li><strong>butter</strong></li>
    <li><strong>brown mushrooms</strong></li>
    <li><strong>all-purpose flour</strong> - helps thicken up the sauce.</li>
    <li><strong>Italian seasoning</strong></li>
    <li><strong>garlic</strong></li>
    <li><strong>dry marsala wine</strong></li>
    <li><strong>chicken broth</strong></li>
    <li><strong>heavy cream</strong></li>
    <li><strong>fresh parsley</strong> - for garnish on top.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps></h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the chicken.</strong> Slice each chicken breast carefully in half lengthwise (horizontally) and place one at a time, between 2 sheets of cling wrap or in a ziploc freezer bag. Carefully flatten the chicken breasts with a rolling pin until they are approximately ¼ inch thick. Don't pound the breasts too hard as it could tear apart the breast. Ideally, you want flattened chicken breasts to a uniform thickness. Season both sides of each chicken breast with salt and pepper. Prepare a shallow plate with flour and dip the chicken into the flour, evenly coating on both sides. Set aside.</li>
    <li><strong>Sear the chicken.</strong> Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high for 2 minutes until the hot oil sizzles. Sear the chicken for about 5 minutes per side until golden brown and fully cooked through. The internal temperature for the chicken should reach 165F. Transfer the chicken to a plate.</li>
    <li><strong>Make the creamy mushroom sauce.</strong> In the same skillet, melt butter and sauté mushrooms until golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes. Add a little more olive oil, if needed. Stir in flour, Italian seasoning and garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in marsala wine, chicken broth, and cream and whisk well until the sauce is smooth and uniform. Reduce heat to medium and bring the sauce to a simmer until thickened to a desired consistency, about 4-5 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Assemble and serve.</strong> Return the chicken to skillet and toss well to coat, allowing the chicken to cook and soak in the sauce for 1-2 minutes. Garnish with parsley and serve immediately with pasta, rice, or over mashed potatoes.</li>

<h3>HOW TO SERVE CHICKEN MARSALA</h3>
<p>Serve this creamy chicken marsala over a plate of pasta. I recommend a long pasta like spaghetti, fettuccine, or linguine. I also like serving chicken marsala over rice, mashed potatoes (or garlic mashed cauliflower for a low carb options), or roasted potatoes.
</p>
<p>You can also serve it on its own with some crusty bread for dipping and soaking up every last drop of that delicious rich sauce. A light salad on the side would also be amazing with this such as a Chickpea Wedge Salad or Mediterranean Orzo Pasta Salad.
